3.    I do not have a technical background or programming experience. But programming is very interesting to me. This is a new area for me where I can realize my potential. After graduation my university, I realized that I was missing a new one, as if education had stopped. Maybe for some it’s normal, but I can’t stand still, I want to study, I want to learn more new things. I have strong nerves and am quite patient. When I write code and create simple programs, it gives me pleasure. However, it is quite difficult to develop independently and make in minds tasks for yourself. I am very glad that such courses have been organized where a person without technical education can learn real coding.  ***I hope I can complete this course successfully. The main thing is that I am determined to work seriously.***
4. Self-education in JS, CSS, HTML, Python.
5. Something like this tasks on [learn-javascript](https://learn.javascript.ru):
```javascript
function sort(arr) {
    if (arr.length == 0) return [];
    let a = [], b = [], beg = arr[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) { 
      if (arr[ i ] < beg) a[a.length] = arr[ i ];
      else b[b.length] = arr[ i ];
}

    return sort(a).concat( beg,sort(b) );
}
alert(sort(arr));
```
